## About the 164 Argentine-British Squadron
![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/lFM8ENV.jpg)

`When World War 2 broke out in Europe, over 800 Argentine volunteers, mostly of Anglo-Argentine descent, joined the British and Canadian Air Forces, many of them served in the 164 Argentine-British RAF squadron. The 164 saw action first over the English Channel and then over Europe. Around 150 of them were killed and many taken prisoners.`

`These men stories remained untold for a number of reasons, but partly because after the war the pilots scattered, some staying in Europe, some going home and others emigrating. `

`Based on public records, i built this little project to help keep alive the memory of these people, and preserve the record of service and the achievements of the 164.`
